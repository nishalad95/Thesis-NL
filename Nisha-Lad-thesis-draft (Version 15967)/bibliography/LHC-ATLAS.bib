title = {Machine learning predictor for ‘measurement-to-track’ association for the ATLAS Inner Detector trigger},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {The track finding algorithm adopted for the LHC Run-2 data taking period is based on combinatorial track following, where the number of seeds scales non-linearly with the number of hits. The corresponding CPU time increase, close to cubical, creates huge and ever-increasing demand for computing power. This is particularly problematic for the silicon tracking detectors, where the hit occupancy is the largest. Therefore, it is essential that resource use is reduced, whilst maintaining the ability to reconstruct tracks with minimal loss in efficiency. This paper briefly summarises the work that has been done to optimise the HLT ID track seeding software for ATLAS Run-3 and beyond, in order to reduce the number of fake seeds constructed. An ML-based algorithm has been developed to predict if a pair of hits belong to the same track given input hit features, focusing on cluster width and inverse track inclination. The implementation of the trained predictor in the form of Look-Up Tables is presented, along with performance results in terms of tracking efficiency and speed-up factor using simulated data.}

The number of filters is kept small by a suitable collapsing procedure. We report results on the precision of the estimated track parameters and on the computational load required by the algorithm with non-Gaussian observation errors. We also develop the correct smoothing algorithm and discuss the treatment of non-Gaussian process noise.}
